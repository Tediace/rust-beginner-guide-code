# Rust Sample with Code Explanation
## Data Types
Every value in Rust is of certain *data type*, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.

Rust is *statically types* language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to used based on the value and how we use it.

### Different Type Annotations for other data types
<details>
  <summary>1) Scaler Types </summary>
  
  - **Integer Types**
    An *integer* is a number without a fractional component.

    Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.

```rust
  fn main() {
       let x = 2.0; // f64
       let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
  }
  ```
